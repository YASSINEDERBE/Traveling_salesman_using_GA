# Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using Genetic Algorithm (GA)
the project was developed by both **Ameur Bellil** and **Mohamed Yassine Derbel**

## Description
This project provides a solution to the **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)** using a **Multi-objective Genetic Algorithm (GA)** in Java. The TSP involves finding the shortest possible route that visits a set of cities and returns to the origin city. The Genetic Algorithm is used to approximate a solution by evolving a population of routes over multiple generations, using natural selection principles like selection, crossover, and mutation.

## Features
- **TSP Solving**: Solves the Traveling Salesman Problem using a Genetic Algorithm.
- **Selection**: Selects the best routes based on fitness, where fitness is inversely related to route distance.
- **Crossover**: Combines parent routes to generate new offspring routes.
- **Mutation**: Introduces diversity to avoid local minima and improve the solution.
- **Visualization**: (Optional) Displays a graphical representation of the cities and best routes using Java's Swing.

## Technologies Used
- **Java**: The core implementation is in Java.
- **Java Swing**: For GUI.
